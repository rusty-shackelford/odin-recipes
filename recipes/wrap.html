    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Wraps are an easy lunch option and can be customised to your personal preference, or regularly changed to allow for an easy lunch everyday without getting bored of the same meal</p>
    <p>Wraps generally have a protein, salad, and dressing component. The simplest wraps can be made from salad mix, deli meat, cheese, and mayonaise.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mini wraps</li>
        <li>Salad mix</li>
        <li>Deli meat such as ham</li>
        <li>Cheese slices</li>
        <li>Mayonaise</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place Wrap(s) on a plate or suitable surface for preperation</li>
        <li>Add meat, covering the centre third of the wrap and leaving a 3-5 cm space at the bottom to allow for folding.</li>
        <li>Add cheese slice, it may be helpful to break slice in half and spread the pieces along the centre of the wrap</li>
        <li>Spread mayonaise onto the toppings to taste</li>
        <li>Cover the toppings with salad mix</li>
        <li>Fold the wrap. I generally fold the botton up (folding where there is no topping), and then fold the left and right sides towards the center of the wrap</li>
    </ol>
